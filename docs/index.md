# ðŸ’– Vitale

Vitale is an edge-rendered framework built for Cloudflare Workers.  
It features file-based page routing with dynamic page paths and edge-side data fetching APIs.  

## âœ¨ Features

- Pages are generated and cached using the Cloudflare Worker Cache by default at the edge, similar to Server Side Generation.
- Pages can be revalidated after a specified time, similar to incremental Server Side Generation.
- Pages can also be revalidated on every single request, similar to Server Side Rendering.
- Pages can fetch from your component as a typical AJAX request.
